# carontimerepository

This repository is a copy of the repository located on the bitbucket.
It was established as a group project run and developed by mid-December 2018 by 6 people.
Since then, further changes here are introduced by me.
The project was conducted using the SCRUM method and included programming in pairs, which is why the authors of individual commits do not reflect the exact contribution of individual crew members.

The project is a simulation of a website used to rent cars for minutes.
